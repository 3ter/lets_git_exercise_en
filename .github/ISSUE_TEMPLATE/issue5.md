#### Tasks
Carry out the following steps:
- [ ] Create a new branch named ``feature5_image``
- [ ] Checkout this branch
- [ ] Search on the search engine of your choice for a picture of your charackter that you particularly like. Get the link of this picture by clicking on "Show file" or on the picture and then copy the address from the address bar of your browser.
- Paste the image at the bottom of your website using the HTML expression ``<img src="URL"/>``. Replace the URL with the link to your image.
- Commit your changes and push them.
- [ ] Create a pull request.
- [ ] If both tests have passed, you can merge your changes into the master branch. If the tests fail, look at the comments of the pull request to find out what the problem was. Fix the errors so that the tests pass. A good idea is to repeat the steps of the issue again and see if everything is written correctly. You can also look at the Index.md file on Github and check the correct formatting. If you tried it for 15 minutes without success, you can have a look in the course forum.
- [ ] Delete your feature branch. Switch to the master branch and update your local repository.
- [ ] Take a look at your website and see if something has changed. You may have to update the page a few times.

If you have any questions, you can take a look at the course forum.
