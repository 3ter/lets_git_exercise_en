# Let's Git - Version Control & Open Source Homework
Welcome to this homework for our MOOC: Let's Git! We hope you will learn a lot and have fun working on it.

In this homework you will create a website about your favourite character from a movie or a book. To start the task, simply follow these steps:

- [ ] Use this repository as a template for a new repository and click "Use this template" to create the same repository in your repositories. When creating the repository, name it like this: "\<your github name\>.github.io". For example, if your username is sanjsp, the repository should be called sanjsp.github.io
- [ ] Give the newly created repository a star.
- [ ] Clone the repository to your computer. To do this, go to "Clone or Download" in the top bar and copy the link of the repository. Then in Git Bash, run ``git clone (URL of the repository) ``. My command would look like this ```git clone sanjsp.github.io```
- [ ] Open the repository web page by going to \<your github name\>.github.io in the browser.
- [ ] New issues will appear in your repository over time. Work on them and follow the steps indicated in the issues. Sometimes it can take a  while (max. 5 minutes) to create the issues.

The website changes every time a pull request is made but it will only show the version of the website on the master branch, so changes on other branches will not be visible on the website.  If you want to see the changes you have made to your feature branch, look at the index.md file in your repository on your branch. So if you have problems and tests fail, you can check the index.md file on the github page of the repository. Click on it and look at it in your browser to see what didn't quite work when formatting the content.
